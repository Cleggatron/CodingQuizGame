# Coding Quiz Game

## Description

[https://cleggatron.github.io/CodingQuizGame/](https://cleggatron.github.io/CodingQuizGame/)

This is a short, multiple choice quiz, about Javascript, HTML and CSS. It runs with a timer and allows for the retention of scores in Local Storage.

The motivation for building ths was to serve as a project to practise timer function, local storage, and event listeners. All of these features appear in the project.

## Installation
As the project is solely web based it will require no installation.

Bear in mind that the persistent score tracking will use the local storage of the brower this is run on. THis can be deleted with the clear highscores button on the scorepage, or manually through dev tools.

## Useage
Once the page is loaded click on the Start Game button to run the quiz. Once completed a score can be submitted which will persist in local storage. Buttons in the pages and in the navbar at the top will assist in moving about the page.

## Credits

The code that I used for my reset CSS file was largely derived from the following source (though mild alterations were made).
